    "\n",
    "> * This template is adapted from [Geoscience Australias](https://github.com/GeoscienceAustralia/dea-notebooks) published notebooks.\n",
    "> * Remove the \"**Sign up to JupyterHub** to run this notebook interactively from a browser\" header text if the notebook is not eo2cube-compatible.\n",
    "> * Update the **Compatibility** line depending on whether the notebook is compatible or not.\n",
    "> * When adding **Products used**, embed the link to a specific product description, using `[product_name](product url)` syntax.\n",
    "> * When writing in Markdown cells, start each sentence on a **new line**.\n",
    "This makes it easy to see changes through git commits.\n",
    "> * Use proper English in markdown cells and code comments.\n",
    "> * Check the [known issues](https://github.com/GeoscienceAustralia/dea-docs/wiki/Known-issues) for formatting regarding the conversion of notebooks to DEA docs using Sphinx.\n",
    "Things to be aware of:\n",
    "    * Sphinx is highly sensitive to bulleted lists:\n",
    "        * Ensure that there is an empty line between any preceding text and the list\n",
    "        * Only use the `*` bullet (`-` is not recognised)\n",
    "        * Sublists must be indented by 4 spaces\n",
    "    * Two kinds of formatting cannot be used simultaneously:\n",
    "        * Hyperlinked code: \\[\\`code_format\\`](hyperlink) fails\n",
    "        * Bolded code: \\*\\*\\`code_format\\`\\*\\* fails\n",
    "    * Headers must appear in heirachical order (`#`, `##`, `###`, `####`) and there can only be one title (`#`).\n",
    "> * Use the [PEP8 standard](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for code. To make sure all code in the notebook is consistent, you can use the `jupyterlab_code_formatter` tool: select each code cell, then click `Edit` and then one of the `Apply X Formatter` options (`YAPF` or `Black` are recommended). This will reformat the code in the cell to a consistent style.\n",
    "> * Additional guidance ?!"
