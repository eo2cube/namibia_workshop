This course is an (very, very quick) introduction to (geospatial) Python.

## Installation notes

Following this tutorial will require recent installations of:

- Python >= 3.5 (2.7 was not tested)
- pandas
- geopandas >= 0.3.0
- matplotlib
- rtree
- PySAL
- scikit-learn
- mgwr
- cartopy
- geoplot
- [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org)

If you do not yet have these packages installed, I recommend installing [miniconda](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html) or Anaconda
distribution, found at https://www.anaconda.com/download/).

If Installed, the following command will most probably install all required packages:

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Using another distribution (e.g. Enthought Canopy) or ``pip`` worls also, maybe easier, depending on your subjective knowledge.
