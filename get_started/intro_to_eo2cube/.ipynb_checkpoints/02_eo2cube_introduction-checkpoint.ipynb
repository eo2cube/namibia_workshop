    "\n",
    "The ODC and eo2cube platforms are designed to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Catalogue large amounts of Earth observation data\n",
    "* Provide a Python based API for high performance querying and data access\n",

    "* Track the provenance of data to allow for quality control and updates\n",

    "The eo2cube project catalogues data from a range of satellite sensors and has adopted processes and terminology that users should be aware of to enable efficient querying and use of the datasets stored within.\n",

    "\n",
    "Eo2cube makes use of the Open Data Cube (ODC). ODC is an Open Source Project for the geospatial data management and analyses of Big Earth data such as satellite time series. The overall goal is to unleash the power of satellite data. The core of the ODC is a set of Python libraries and a PostgreSQL database. The impact of the ODC hall be an increased value of continuously provided satellite time series.  Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) is a founding partner of the Open Data Cube (ODC) and is committed to stewarding and contributing to the ODC architecture as part of the ODC community. According to CEOS, eo2cube seeks to encourage others to join the initiative with the goal to meet important goals of societal benefits, similar to the objectives of the Australian Geoscience Data Cube (AGDC) and Google Earth Engine (GEE), but differing inimplementation."

    "Landsat missions are jointly operated by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).\n",
    "Sentinel missions are operated by the European Space Agency (ESA).\n",
    "One major difference between the two programs is the spatial resolution: each Landsat pixel represents 30 x 30 m on the ground while each Sentinel-2 pixel represents 10 x 10 m to 60 x 60 m depending on the spectral band.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Spectral bands\n",
    "All of the datasets listed above are captured by multispectral satellites.\n",
    "This means that the satellites measure primarily light that is reflected from the Earth's surface in discrete sections of the electromagnetic spectrum, known as *spectral bands*. \n",
    "Figure 1 shows the spectral bands for recent Landsat and Sentinel-2 sensors, allowing a direct comparison of how each sensor samples the overall electromagnetic spectrum.\n",

    "\n",
    "> **Figure 1:** The bands that are detected by each of the satellites are shown in the numbered boxes and the width of each box represents the spectral range that band detects.\n",
    "The bands are overlaid on the percentage transmission of each wavelength returned to the atmosphere from the Earth relative to the amount of incoming solar radiation. \n",
    "The y-axis has no bearing on the comparison of the satellite sensors [[source]](https://directory.eoportal.org/web/eoportal/satellite-missions/l/landsat-9).\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 1 highlights that the numbering of the bands relative to the detected wavelengths is inconsistent between sensors.\n",
    "As an example, in the green region of the electromagnetic spectrum (around 560 nm), Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 7 ETM+ detect a wide green region called band 2, where as Landsat 8 OLI detects a slightly narrower region and calls it band 3.\n",
    "Finally, Sentinel-2 MSI (A and B) detects a narrow green region but also calls it band 3.\n",
    "Consequently, when working with different sensors, it is important to understand the differences in their bands, and any impact this could have on an analysis.\n",
    "Eo2cube tries to take this into account by using \n",
    "To promote awareness of these differences, DEA band naming is based on both the spectral band name and sample region.\n",

    "eo2cube offers Analysis Ready Data (ARD) for each of the sensors listed above. \n",
    "The [ARD standard](http://ceos.org/ard/) for satellite data requires that data have undergone a number of processing steps, along with the creation of additional attributes for the data.\n",
    "DEA's ARD datasets include the following characteristics:\n",

    "* **Geometric correction:** This includes establishing ground position, accounting for terrain (orthorectification) and ground control points, and assessing absolute position accuracy. \n",
    "Geometric calibration means that imagery is positioned accurately on the Earth's surface and stacked consistently so that sequential observations can be used to track meaningful change over time.\n",
    "Adjustments for ground variability typically use a Digital Elevation Model (DEM).\n",
    "* **Surface reflectance correction:** This includes adjustments for sensor/instrument gains, biases and offsets, include adjustments for terrain illumination and sensor viewing angle with respect to the pixel position on the surface.\n",
    "Once satellite data is processed to surface reflectance, pixel values from the same sensor can be compared consistently both spatially and over time.\n",
    "* **Observation attributes:** Per-pixel metadata such as quality flags (pixel_qa, Landsat) or the sen2cor scene classification (scl, Sentinel 2) and content attribution that enable users to make informed decisions about the suitability of the products for their use. For example, clouds, cloud shadows, missing data, saturation and water are common pixel level attributes.\n",

    "Optical sensors, such as those on the Landsat and Sentinel-2 satellites, measure light that has come from the sun and been reflected by the Earth's surface.\n",

    "The intensity of this light is affected by many factors including the angle of the sun relative to the ground, the angle of the sensor relative to the ground, and how the light interacts with the Earth's atmosphere on its way to the sensor. \n",
    "Because radiance can be affected by so many factors, it is typically more valuable to determine how much light was originally reflected at the ground level.\n",
    "This is known as bottom-of-atmosphere **surface reflectance**, or Level 2A data.\n",
